# Alpha Creation Engine

This project will host all code related to the Alpha Creation Engine

**Installation Instructions**

We recommend using one of the following IDEs for coding and analysis in Python for this competition.
Both IDEs will install the underlying Python language requirements and the most commonly used packages along with it. For specific requirements refer to requirements.txt

Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook) -
Anaconda installs multiple IDEs including Jupyter Notebooks.
You can download Anaconda for your respective machine from https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads
